**_I.T Lesson 21_**

In this lesson we took notes, and reset githubâ€¦

When we first came into the lesson, we went over several pieces of homework, and went over the mistakes. I learned that if there is a problem, do your best to solve it. After coming to the conclusion that some of our githubs were broken and needed fixing. In order to do this, we deleted our repository and restarted. We then reset our name and avatar, which is why you may notice a change in aesthetics. The process of resetting and setting background I feel went very well and smoothly. I had no problems with is, apart from getting the avatar.
