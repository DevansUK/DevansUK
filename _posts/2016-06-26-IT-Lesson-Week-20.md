**In this lesson we focused on making our own games in Micro:bit**

In micro:bit, we made our own games using the knowledge we have of the system and code. We did this after doing our plans for previous homeworks, however i had to change my game plan after realising that it would not be successful.

Originally I was doing a true or false game, however there were not enough buttons in order for this plan to go through and so I scrapped it, and thought of a new game that involved going around and painting. Although it may not be the prettiest, the concept worked well.

There is not much to this blog, as the lesson was just creating our games and I was set back.
