**IT BLOG 2**

**LESSON 2**

**My target: To fix my blog and get farther in the coding book**

**I reached both my targets.**

In today's lesson we did the same as last time, however I had to fix my blog and I will walk through how I did so. At first, I made the mistake of asking how to fix it, but Mr. Keen denied it but instead made me think of the possible problems and solutions. At last after guessing, I found out that full stops are counted as special characters however I could have done that myself as all the answers were on google classroom and I could have just read that..

In the second part of the lesson we carried on through the book and I progressed well. Also, after finding out how to color text and the background, I used those skills to be creative and made a multicolored text pattern and background. I did this by using the basic code for one color, then wrote it out multiple times but changing the color in which it displayed each time so it made a rainbow.
