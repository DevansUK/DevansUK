**IT LESSON 3**

Today was lesson 4. To summarise it, we worked through the books as our main focus, however in the first part of the lesson we went over blogs.

**Blogs**

We talked about blogs and looked at some examples of some blogs of other people like Mr. Tansley's. The thing that made his different from other peoples were the background. He changed his to make it different. Although not specifying how, you had to listen to him in order to get a general idea of it. Mr. Tansley also changed the font to fit the theme of his blog. I would have to question more in order to find the details of the font and theme.

**Fuze box**

In the second section of the lesson we set up the fuze box. Unfortunately our leading wires were faulty so we had to be delayed. We couldn't figure out how to fix this so Mr. Keen told us to use the projector in order to do our work. Last week I forgot to bring a memory stick in so I accidently saved it onto another box so we have to redo that work. If I was listening at the part where he said "bring in a memory stick" in the first lesson I wouldn't have made this mistake. Iâ€™m going to bring a memory stick next lesson
