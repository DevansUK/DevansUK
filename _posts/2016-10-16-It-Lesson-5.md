**Hey!**

**Today was lesson 5 and this is the blog for it. Enjoy!**

Today Mr Keen was ill so we had a cover teacher. We also only did the FUZE boxes and skipped all blog talk/reviews

For the 3rd week in a row, our trailing cable didn't work so we had to use the projector. This time we had problems with saving ours. My memory stick was believed to be broken so we couldn't save it. Anyway, this week our actual code broke. After writing the code from the book and trying to run it, it did not work. We read on to see if it was written incorrectly deliberately and was a trap. Unfortunately it wasn’t. We tried to change it to see if we could fix it by trial and error but we couldn’t. With no-one to ask and the lesson ending in less than 5 minutes, we started to pack up and saving what work we had a bit earlier than others.

**Thanks for watching the blog!**
