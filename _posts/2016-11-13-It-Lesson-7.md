    <td>Today was about our blogs and the scores we got on them. I got a 6 out of 9 and I am satisfied with it. One of the tips given was to improve the looks of it. A lot of them were very plain and had a default, bland looking font and colour scheme. Listening was the key to improving in this as most things people had problems with were solved. Questioning was also an effective strategy.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on deeper questioning as I will be able to go deeper and I would be able to learn more. In the lesson I only asked how to do basic things that were necessary to get the top marks. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will change my font on my blog as it is quite bland and there isn't much variation. If I question in more detail I will be able to learn more, hence improving my learning. I will also do my own research and self-teach using websites like W3Schools</td>
