    <td>Today you had to apply yourself to learning and be engaged. I did this and I found that it was a lot easier to advance through instructions. As well as this I also solved the problem by removing the $ on the end of Age as that was creating a string. </td>

    <td>In the lesson I didn't do actions quick enoughn. When we found a faulty connection to the monitor, I waited to ask if we could work on the projector when I should have asked straight away. </td>
