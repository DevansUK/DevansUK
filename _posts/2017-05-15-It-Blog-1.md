In today's lesson we carried on with our Code academy. 

For most of the lesson I was independent and I found with was the most effective way to get my work done as I got several medals and learned a lot so next time I will do the same. I believe the reason this worked well was because I could concentrate on getting the task done and understanding it and if I had talked I may have found myself getting the answers but not understanding what was happening and why.

Despite this I still could have been more effective by researching in the glossary to try and find out what was going wrong. This could help me improve as it widens my knowledge and gives me answers I needed. The one area I struggled with the most was Date and Time as that combined a lot of previous information and was very specific and picky with what you had to do. However I learned the most out of this section as it reminded my why certain lines of code had to be the way they were.

These are the medals I got since the first lesson.![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/rOkbUggQVb3IvBR17NRYUQ_img_0.jpg)
