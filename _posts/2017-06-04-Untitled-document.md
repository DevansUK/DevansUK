IT Term 3 Blog 2

Last lesson I learnt the value of working together and asking questions. As I advance in the website it gets harder meaning working with others becomes a more important value.

I did not get and medals as the section that I was on was not something I understood.

Using "and", “or” and “not” was very hard as they weren't used in the way I previously understood them as.

Next week I will communicate more in order to complete the tasks. 

However. I did use my resources well as well as improving on last week where I rushed. This week I took my time to understand and break down the problem.
