IT Term 3 Blog 3

Last lesson I did a lot better in terms of communication. I asked more questions and collaborated with others. I made more progress this way and recited my skills to help others behind me. The sections with AND, NOT and OR were a struggle last week however I passed them this time with relative ease. I finally got my head around them and I used the glossary to my advantage when it told me to create a variable. Since I hadn't used them in a while I had to check the glossary to understand them and use them. I also found out that when doing "return" lines along with some others that they have to be placed in the same place along the line. They have to be in line with each other otherwise it doesâ€™nt work
