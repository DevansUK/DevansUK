IT Term 3 Blog 4

In the first one of the "PygLatin" section it was very specific and if you had a line in the wrong place it fails. I worked together with my partner to find what was wrong with mine as he had his correct. I found out that his was correct because his was in a different order to mine.

This strategy was effective as it meant we both benefited as he knew what he did correctly and I knew what I did wrong.

The thing that held back my learning was my hesitation to ask. This meant I was not working well and wasn't advancing. This, however, can have its limits as it means I may end up relying on others too much and not understanding. PygLatinâ€™s Ending Up section was a challenge for me as it was very complicated and required extreme precision. It introduced multiple new lines of code that I was not familiar with.

My blogs have not been showing images I put in recently. They worked on my first blog this term but not anymore despite having not changed anything in code or layout.
