**IT Term 3 Blog 6**

In today's lesson a lot the group were doing HOAC so I moved next a different person. This came in handy later…

Today collaboration was key as** **tasks became harder. In a level called "Practise makes perfect" it asked me to proof read the code given, to my understanding. This proved harder than I thought as it used full words like “number” instead of 'n'. It also required me to remove code and replace it with different expressions using symbols. I didn’t understand the task at hand and so collaborated with someone who had completed the level. 

After this I began importing 'math' and ‘sqrt’ imports. I learned how to import modules and specific functions to tell python how to do square rooting and more.

I then learned about the Universal Import and how it isn't as great as it seems. What it does is it imports an entire module which causes functions to be mixed up and confusing. This section is easier to learn than others as it is logical (to me atleast)
