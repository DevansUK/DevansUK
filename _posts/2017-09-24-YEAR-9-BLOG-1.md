**Blog One of Year 9**

In today's lesson we moved on from coding in Year 8. We are now doing Google Sheet functions. In Google Sheets you can do a lot more than just put letters and numbers in boxes. Using functions you can do advanced calculations and processes quickly. We used an example of creating a shop and making a stock sheet and more. 

In the lesson I didn't participate and answer questions as much as I should have  however I am happy with my work in class. I did everything on time to a good level. I understood most of the functions, apart from one, which I will talk about later. In Year 8 I collaborated and helped others. I did not do that as much in this, although I helped my partner in times when he was stuck.

When having to do the "Buy price x Profit percentage" function I got stuck and have fallen slightly behind. In lessons I will ask questions if I don't understand something instead of being scared and thinking “I'll ask later” and never doing so.

Overall I am satisfied with my work and will attempt to continue with the overall level of work, just using the previously stated comments to improve.
