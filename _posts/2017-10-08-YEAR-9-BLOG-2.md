**Blog Two of Year 9**

In today's we carried on creating discount codes and making the functions for them. I am finding this quite difficult, as I usually do with coding. 

To improve I talked to my partner and we helped each other. This has helped me and him a lot this term and so I will continue to work together. This is beneficial for me and him as we can help each other in different areas of the spreadsheet work.

Next lesson I will continue to do this as this is helping. I got stuck for a long time this lesson so I will ask the teacher if I need help as he can often help me. Although he will not tell me the answers, which is more beneficial for me as it helps me learn and develop my coding skills rather than learning to copy off of the board.
