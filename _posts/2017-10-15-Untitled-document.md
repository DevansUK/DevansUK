**Blog Two of Year 9**

In today's session we reviewed and created sheets for different costs and finances for our business. 

For example: Wages, furnishing, gas, water, electricity, servers, shipping, advertising, insurance, security and more. We created a sheet for wages and worked out how much we would pay our workers. We used: Hours per day x D per W x Pay per Hour x Months per Year x Earnings per Month = Salary

Otherwise known as " =PRODUCT(F3:G3)

I used collaberation again to do this and I also helped my partner. This was very efficiant and solved the problem quicker and easier. I used this habbit every week and will continue to use it as it is giving me knowledge.

A habbit I will abandon is overcomplecating it. In IT you have to thing logicly and solve the problem step-by-step, however I have over thought it and tried to do everything at once in nthe past.
