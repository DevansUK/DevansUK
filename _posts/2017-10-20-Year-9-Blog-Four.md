**Year 9 Blog Four**

In this lesson, we finalized our business spreadsheet. 

We calculated our profits, using all our costs and profits to work out if our business would rise or fall.

We used formulas to work out the profit. My business failed as I payed my workers too much in comparison to my stock selling prices.

Next time I do something like this is I will plan out my business to make profit.

This lesson I used collaboration to succeed (in learning). This is what I did in the previous lessons and it has been working well and is a good learning habit, in some cases, as it benefits me and my partner. 

Next time I will plan out my business to make profit rather than heading straight in and not thinking how it will turn out.
