**_Year 9 Blog Five_**

In today's lesson we carried on doing our cypher code converter. We went over the ISerror and left(right function.

In the lesson I should have asked more questions and collaborated to get the answer and understand the solution. If I had collaborated I could have understood the ISerror and Left functions so I could have progressed further in my cypher adventures.

 I did get the basics correct, however, so the basic system did work. I understood the basic coding and issues and so could help my partner if he needed to fix or do a part of the cypher code code.
