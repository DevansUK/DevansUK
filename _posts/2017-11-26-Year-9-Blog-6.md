**YEAR 9 BLOG SIX**

Today we were cleaning up our cypher spreadsheet, meaning we made all of the complicated and unclear process of making a code into cypher a simple process of writing text in, and getting an output a few lines down. This created a easier place to work as I know  

I fixed the left(right function by replacing it with =MID. I worked this out at home by researching the thing I needed to do in Google.

I also completed the IFERROR function by looking up how to do it and fixed it, this was the thing that helped me the most.

I used my resources(google) to find =MID and IFERROR, went well and will do again

Helped others around me by sharing my work and explaining it to them, continue

I asked the teacher for clarity and will continue IF NEEDED.

To improve I should not hesitate as much and try and do things right the first time and be careful otherwise i would i have to go in and fix code in each box or start again in the right place
