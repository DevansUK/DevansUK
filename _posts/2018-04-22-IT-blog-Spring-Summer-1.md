In the lesson we started our own game that took inputs from the player and gave responses. 

This was a lot simpler than I thought and it was the same code changed. We had used some of the skills in the past but we learned things such as "input" to tell the person to enter a message.

I also learned to use custom plugins to make the game more exciting and less bland.

I think I should have researched more into more advanced systems instead of just the one however the coding I used was good and gave options for the future. It could be useful for more complex themes and games.
