In today's lesson buzzfeed quizzes were the main subject. We learned to create multiple choice questions and create outcomes based off of your answers. We used a number system, converting the users input of 1, 2 and 3 into numbers to add up and create ranges.

I learned to persevere but to use the example to shape my answers which I will continue into future lessons. I learned that it is easier to create multiple choice and some stuff we had learned in the past came back to help us. I will continue using previous knowledge to improve my work.
