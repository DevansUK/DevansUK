    <td>In today's lesson I used my past knowledge of how to use hdmi cables and switch sources on monitors in conjunction to skills and instructions that Mr. Keen gave me to set up a computer to a monitor and power supply. I wasn’t very interactive during this lesson but I did try to ask around how they setup their system instead always asking the teacher.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was my inability to think through steps. I saw the instruction and did it, but didn’t think what it was actually doing. When we went onto the systems and used the basic coding feature, I didn’t think what it was doing, but in reality it made perfect sense. For example, one line was something along the lines of: Print: "Hello World"
In retrospect it makes perfect sense what it's doing</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will take time to see what it is actually doing instead of just watching it doing it from afar. I will also ask more questions into how something works, or the steps it's taking that aren't shown on the screen. This will improve my learning in my knowledge of facts and at the sametime help me to solve problems that aren't necessarily in IT or computing.</td>
